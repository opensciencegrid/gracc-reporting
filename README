# README FILE FOR EMAILED REPORTS#
Will build this up eventually



Notes:
* For security reasons, this git repo doesn't have the certs to authenticate to gracc.opensciencegrid.org in it.  You will need to get those certs (contact Kevin Retze or Shreyas Bhat)
and put them in a folder called gracc_cert and put the folder in this directory.  The files the reporting script JobSuccessReport.py looks for are the pem file and the key file, which are
specified in the script on the line that begins with "client=Elasticsearch"

* To do a dryrun, the syntax for running a report is something like this:

python JobSuccessReport.py -c jobrate.config -E nova -s '2016/06/22 06:30:01' -e '2016/06/23 06:30:01'  -T template_jobrate.html -d

Change the date/times, and the VO.  -v makes it verbose.





./EfficiencyReporterPerVO.py -s 2016/07/04 -e 2016/07/05 -E uboone -d -c efficiency.config -v -F GPGrid
